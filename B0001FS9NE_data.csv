5.0,False,"04 21, 2015",A31N0XY2UTB25C,B0001FS9NE,,Stephanie Sullivan,"The Netgear ProSAFE 8-port Gigabit Click Switch is a office-space networking game changer. The unique office-friendly design with integrated mounting and cable management are stand-out differentiators. This ""smart-switch"" has management capability appropriate for a office environment switch with power-saving electronics.

Design:
One of the first things that stands out on the ProSAFE Click switches is the form factor. The sleek dimensions clearly have the modular office environment in mind and can mount at many places in modular non-modular office environments.

The click mounting system makes mounting a snap - literally. The locking tab make secure mounting of the Click Switch to the base in any of 2 orientations.

The 8 port version has a sturdy plastic case in a silent fanless design. The 16 port model is also fanless, but has a durable metal case.

The 8 port model provides 2 convenient USB charging ports suitable for tablets and other high-charge USB applications.  The power budget is 15W for both and any one port limited to 10W. This makes it handy in offices and conference rooms making it convenient for tablets or phones to get a charge boost. I like this in my home office because it eliminates 2 power bricks from my power strip.

The interesting power connection can be plugged in to have the cable exit either in the same direction and the network cables or at 90 degrees to that out the long dimension. There is no ""power brick"" to clog up power strips - the power adapter is internal to the switch. Something I find a very desirable feature.

The included Velcro cables tie completes the picture of switch design by someone who was thinking about usability in the real world as much as moving bits and bytes.

Configuration:
I downloaded and installed the ProSafe Plus Configuration Utility from the Netgear support site. The configuration utility found the switch automagically making it super easy perform initial setup on the Click Switch. The intuitive process was easy and there are only a couple of things to setup unless you need advanced features.

' Set the IP address - I recommend setting either a static IP address or a DHCP reserved address (what I did in my firewall) so the switch will always be at the same IP address.
' Change the password - The default password is ""password"", so change it to something better!

The Click Switch also has a web based management interface that is very usable if you prefer that instead of the configuration utility. I do.

The advanced (and just nice) configurable features include:
' The port LEDs can be turned off so they are not distracting (Just nice and good for bedrooms too!)
' IEEE 802.1Q-or port-based VLANs are supported for segregated traffic (i.e. voip/data)
' Extensive QoS by WRR, strict priority, or both, Port-based QoS, IEEE 801.2p QoS, ToS QoS and DSCP based QoS. These are to help make sure time sensitive traffic gets priority (i.e. voip or video).
' Port by port Rate limiting
' Port by port link speed and flow control settings (including a ""disable"" setting to turn a port off if desired)
' Port by port Broadcast Filtering
' Port by port cable testing (good for a quick cable integrity check)
' Multicast control via IGMP snooping
' Port mirroring which connects two ports like a old school hub (good for troubleshooting or some monitoring)

Note: the 8 port model has no LAG (Link Aggregation Groups aka Trunking). The 16 port model has up to 2 LAG group which can be nice for devices with 2 LAN ports that support static LAG. NAS devices come to mind.

Most users will not need to mess with most of the advanced features.

Green Power Use:
The 8 port Click Switch uses a max of 20.1W of power including 15W of USB charging occurring at the same time. This means without someone charging their device power maxes out about 5W. With smart port power management most of the time power consumption should be less. Perhaps much less. This is less power than used to be common for unmanaged or ""dumb"" switches. The savings can add up if you have a bunch of these in your business.

Support:
I did not need to contact support with the 8 port Click switch, but while testing my 16 port model I did and got excellent support. Be sure to register your Click switch within 30 days of purchase and you'll get  a lifetime warranty for a little extra peace of mind.

Conclusions:
The Netgear ProSAFE 8-Port Gigabit Click Switch has game-changing office oriented design and usability in a silent package. It is a capable smart switch which has good management and important features. The advanced features can make it possible to reliably integrate time sensitive traffic in the same switch as NAS file sharing, isolate traffic via VLAN support and more.

The switch is wire-speed which means it can move traffic as fast as it can be pushed over the individual LAN cables. In my testing this is the case as with pretty much any modern smart and many ""dumb"" switches. Getting data through a switch has become pretty much a given these days.

I had moved away from Netgear switches in recent years. Other manufacturers had more attractive solutions for my clients' needs. Not so with the Click Switch. Because Netgear has built a compelling product for office (and many other) environments with a fairly rich feature set and easily managed I'm giving it 5 stars.

I'll be placing these into my client environments as new switches are needed. Well done Netgear.

This is a great array for someone looking to expand their home storage network or possibly someone with a SOHO setup that needs plenty of storage. I used this array to combine many different drives I had laying around from past system builds as well as to give me a central place to go for over 15TB of storage.

Unpacking

The array arrived well packed with two layers of boxes and internal Styrofoam.

Installation

You will definitely want to buy the optional rackmount mounting rails. The railkit costs approximately $32 more but was worth not having to sit the array on top of another rackmount device. There is no way the front brackets will hold the weight of the array empty let alone full of hard drives.

Hardware

All hardware was included. eSATA cables, SATA cables, power cables, drive trays, and drive tray mounting screws were included. The chassis is reasonably high quality metal, and I believe the power supply is a standard ATX power supply which is always preferred over some custom form factor so that if the OE PS dies you can get another one from anywhere. The array has plenty of fans, so far I have 12 drives in the array and no cooling issues.

The array is surprisingly quiet even when fully populated with WD Caviar Greens. The fans are barely noticeable to include the power supply fan. The indicator lights on the front are sparse but do provide basic information such as which drive bays are filled, which drives are active, and which internal RAID controller is active. A nice to have would have been a LCD screen with temp and other environmental info but at this price point its not surprising that its lacking.

One HW feature that I found totally cool was that you can bring your own eSATA port multiplying RAID controller card if you wanted, disable the RAID controller in the array, and use all of your own features with your own RAID controller card.

Software

The CD that came with mine was useless, trying to read it locked up two different laptops so I ended up downloading the latest software right from their website. The GUI interface for their drives and software is terrible, incredibly cheesy, and felt like something developed in the 90's, but it did install without a hitch and instantly recognized the attached array. Configuration of the RAID went without a hitch.

I did all of my configurations from a server running Windows Server 8 BETA x64 so I can say its not only Windows Server 8 BETA compatible its also 64bit compatible driver software.

A nice feature is that the HD's SMART monitoring information is available via the array's driver software.

Features

The amount of storage options this unit provides is awesome. I was looking for a budget eSATA rackmount enclosure with at least 8 drive bays and this unit definitely performs above and beyond my expectations. It offers all the usual RAID levels but the best part is that internally it is comprised of 3 separate RAID controllers which are accessible via 3 separate eSATA ports on the back so if you wanted to you could connect 3 different servers to this array. Also, if you choose to connect a device to the array that does not have a port multiplier eSATA port, you can configure the internal controller of the array to do the port multiplication for you and present a single logical storage volume to the connected device.

During my burn-in testing of my 2TB WDC Green RAID array I saw sustained writes of approximately 86MB/s and reads of approximately 98MB/s for a RAID 5 array of 4 1TB WDC Greens.

The Bad

The only bad thing about this array is the incredibly cheap hard drive carriages. You have to be very careful when mounting, inserting, or removing hard drives from this array. The carriages are very fragile, thin, plastic and will easily crack or break if handled roughly.  Once the drives are properly inserted into the array you should be ok.

Conclusion

This is a great budget minded eSATA RAID enclosure for anyone seeking a ton of drive bays, HW RAID controllers, and storage flexibilty for less than $1000.00. It certainly is not enterprise class, but then again, neither is the price.",Great Array For The Price,1332720000,,

QNAP has one of the best reputations in the industry for quality and workmanship.  This has an extremely low power draw and I've acheived write speeds of 65 MB a second over gigabit ethernet which is far greater than USB 2.0 (roughly 25 MB a second).

This product is half the price of a TS-459 Pro+ ($900 before tax).

I bought all enterprise drives for additional reliability (WD RE4) I'm currently upgrading to Hitachi Ultrastar 3 TB drives.  The new firmware (3.4) from QNAP provides support 3 TB drives.  So max would be 6 TB for Raid-1, 12 TB for (JBOD, RAID 0), and somewhere inbetween for Raid 5.

I have had little to no problems with the NAS device, and when I did have 1 problem updating the firmware, QNAP tech support was top notch.  They remoted into my NAS and fixed the issue.

When I decided to purchase another NAS device (extra speed, more storage), I could not find a better product than this QNAP.  You can find CHEAPER devices from synology, or thecus, but I feel this device is one of the best.

The build quality feels excellent.  When it arrived, it feels and looks like a serious piece of IT equipment (which it is).  The front panel makes it easy to setup.

I had no issues mounting my drives (also purchased through amazon), and performing the setup.  There are a lot of options with the firmware of this device!

It can be setup to email or sms txt message you if there is a problem with it, it has several different built in software applications (like ITUNES server, and bittorrent downloading software), and is expandable with applications you can install through the firmware separately.

It IS a lot of money, and you could build a computer for less money, but at full load this device uses much less energy than a computer, is quieter, and QNAP is always updating the firmware with new features.

They even updated the firmware for my old NAS with most of the new features of the newer ones, so they do not just abandon the old devices until technology has fully passed them by.

After connecting the antenna at the beginning of the docks I was able to get signal all the way to the end of the docks, (about 1 mile), with houseboats completely obscuring any line of sight.  I had five bars almost the entire way to the end of the dock.  When I reached the furthest point from the antenna, I had one bar of signal.  I kept a persistent ping going the entire time, and I did not get a single timeout, even when reduced to one bar.  I tested my Iphone as well and received similar results.

I have several ports at a gig and several at 100FDX.  I leave everything at autonegotiate.  There were a couple times where I switched off autonegotiate on a port and a particular PC because of an intermittent link outage and I was suspecting a problem with the autonegotiate.  But in the end, both times ended up being the same RJ-45 plug at the PC end of the 60 foot CAT-5 cable.  After finally cutting it off and crimping on a new connector, my intermittent problem went away.  This was one of my gig links.  My system maxes out at 450 Mbps point-to-point so I can't test at gig speeds.  Inserting the switch did not make any difference which is good.  One time, I configured three ports in two VLANs, (i.e. port 1 tagged to VLAN 2; port 2 untagged to default VLAN; port 3 tagged to VLAN 2 and a member of the default VLAN).  I could not get it to work with my PCs but I believe my NICs were not working properly with VLAN tags because Wireshark on all three computers never showed me a tagged frame even when I ran straight cable between two PCs configured for tagged VLANs.  In any event, while going through all these configuration changes on the switch, it never locked up or acted strangely.  The unaffected ports outside my little VLAN test remained functional.  So the only gripe I have with small devices like this is that they are too light.  They are at the mercy of the weight of the cables plugged into them.

It performs quite well with a good range (I was able to walk anywhere in a 15x15 room without loss of connectivity).

The product does come with a CD that contains both the basic drivers as well as the application that I needed to make this headset work with Skype on my Windows XP machine.

If I may offer a tip for fellow Skype users to help reduce frustration:  Insert the dongle into the USB slot & allow XP to install the drivers.  Then, go to the CD & install the BTW utility that applies to your operating system.  If the CD doesn't auto-run, just open the drive via My Computer & double click on the index.html icon.  It will walk you though several options, including pairing a headset.  Finally, go into Skype's audio settings (Tools/Options/Audio Settings) and choose blue tooth from the drop down lists for microphone, speakers, ringing, what ever you want to work through the headset.

I have had to re-select the Bluetooth option in Skype each time I shut down my PC.  I believe that is an issue with Skype though & not an issue really related in any way to the dongle.  It's a painless 3 clicks, so it's not a huge deal in my opinion.

This hub has the power to drive not only the full USB 2.0 rated current capacities, but beyond.  It means that, for example, one of its USB ports can power up a Western Digital Passport external USB hard disk drive which is very unusual for a hub.  Since the idea of buying a USB hub is to move functions away from your limited number of computer USB ports (especially a notebook computer!), the more of those functions it can move, the better.  And this device will let you plug that Passport in where it is out of your way.  The device is well laid out, too.  The power, input USB port, and three of the seven USB output ports are on the back end of the device (above where it says ""T7Hub"" in the photograph) which makes cable routing easier for ""permanent"" devices like printers, scanners, etc., since the cables for those come from behind it (and don't clutter the front).

That device has BOTH an ethernet port for wired lans, and a PCMCIA slot to insert a wireless networking card, but it must be of a given brand and model (from a list of supported cards).

I wanted to hook the device to my LAN without drilling holes on walls, and I didn't want to have to seek a special pcmcia card. So I went with one Sony PCWA-DE80. I connected to the Prismiq ethernet port and Bingo!, instant wireless connectivity to my Netgear 802.11a Wireless Access Point!.

A bonus with one of these devices you can say GOODBYE to WIFI driver issues. You just need a WIFI access point next to your adsl or cable modem, and this device. Then you can hook ANYTHING with a working ethernet port to your wireless lan!. It could be  a PC or any other device (could be a game console!). You plug the Sony ethernet-to-wifi converter into the device's RJ45 ethernet port and ... instant wireless connectivity. As far as the PC or  device is concerned, it's talking to a wired ethernet, even while it's not, as the sony devices bridges wifi to wired ethernet networks!.

Setup is a breeze. Just point your browser to the devices's IP address and enter your wifi configuration data (supports wep up to 128 bits), the IP address that you want assigned to it, and that's it!. Then when you plug this unit to any device with an ethernet port, that device will immediately connect to your wifi network!. I even used one of these boxes to get instant WiFi connectivity on my old lan server running IBM OS/2, an operating system that doesn't have plenty of WiFi cards supported (if any).

Another bonus: switch operating systems painlessly, don't worry about the availability of wifi drivers!. I test software for a living, so I often find myself installing several flavors of Linux on my notebook. However, availability of Wifi drivers for Linux is scarce. So, instead of having to thinker with the computer, I just tell linux to use the notebook's ethernet port, and I then plug the SONY ethernet to wifi converter and that's it. Instant connection and no need to drill holes on the walls.

The downside: It's expensive, like most Sony gear. You can probably find several less expensive ""ethernet to Wi-Fi"" converters on the market, but to my knowledge the Sony ones are the ONLY that support the 5 Ghz 802.11a standard!, all cheaper devices work ONLY in the 2.4 Ghz frequency, using either 802.11b or 802.11g. I choose 802.11a because, while older, the 5 Ghz band is less prone to interference from 2.4 Ghz cordless phones, microwave ovens (did you know your microwave oven operates at 2.4 ghz?), and wireless security cameras, all of which pollute the 2.4 Ghz frequency spectrum.

The PCWADE80 works BOTH in 2.4 Ghz frequency (802.11b ang ""g"") and also in 802.11a. Unlike the previous model (PCWADE50) this one claims to support 72mbps ""turbo"" mode in 802.11a! (haven't tested it).","Expensive, but worth it! painless and powerful",1099440000,,

Recently, I bought a less expensive USB 2.0 card at a local retailer thinking a usb card is a usb card.  I had a horrible time installing it and it never really worked right.  When I purchased a Western Digital USB 2.0 External Hard Drive to add to my system is when I found out not all usb cards are created the same. The WD hard drive just would not operate on the cheaper usb 2.0 card. I could not transfer files or write to the drive without getting errors.  I thought it was the hard drive but after exchanging it and getting another one only to have the same problem I determined it must be the usb controller.
That is when I searched the net and looked at reviews for the best USB 2.0 card out right now.  Every computer magazine website gave this card excellent reviews so I thought I would buy it from Amazon.com and give it a try.
It was very easy to install and I absolutely love the added front USB port which is included in the box and fits in an open 5 1/4 bay.  Since I have an older machine I did not have any front usb ports. With this in mind along with the great reviews it has been given the purchase was a no brainer. I believe the NEC drivers which this card uses makes it top notch.  I would recommend this card highly.",Great USB 2.0 Card...,1078185600,,

What I mean is, you are supposed to download the driver (CDROM or online) and then install the card. Windows XP recognized it immediately and it works as advertised at 480 Mbits/sec. If you must know just one important thing about USB 2.0, remember not to unplug the peripheral device when the PC is on. Power down first, then unplug the device, be it printer, digital camera, external HD, or cordless microphone. It could result in a crash and/or data loss (Thanks to Christine for this word of advice).",So Easy,1078012800,,

The card works great on my P3-800 at work, running Windows 2000.  Installed without a bit of trouble, and works perfectly.  Following the installation directions had me up and running in a few minutes, and the PC recognized the card and loaded the drivers (which I'd put on from the install CD) immediately without a single hitch.

The setup took just a few minutes to complete the setup wizard and after that everything worked from the first time, perfectly.
I have now wireless connectivity throughout the whole house. The connection is stable and the speed is as advertised.
I considered Linksys and Netgear routers, but there always was some kind of problem with them.
I have not found any complaints with this 3Com router. Also my personal experience with 3Com products was another factor for my decision to by this product.
Bottom line - if you are looking for reliable, easy to use router this product is for you.","Good product, which is very easy to setup and use",1064534400,,
