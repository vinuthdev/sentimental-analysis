5.0,True,"12 2, 2013",A3H1L8J408EMXK,B00F8K9MZQ,{'Platform:': ' PC/Mac Disc'},Great Poobah,I've used Turbotax since it first came out and find it an excellent buy. Most people using an accountant would save a bunch of money using it. It has an easy step process that walks you through the entire process and your state tax is automatically prepared as you prepare your federal tax. A friend tried it recreating his tax that had been prepared by his accountant and found Turbotax lowered his tax.,An excellent buy,1385942400,4,

This year's version is pretty much the same as past years and I am glad because I have used the software for as long as I can remember and I like following the same walk through routine that TurboTax makes you follow.  Using TurboTax is fast and easy and I like several features that I use every year:

* The ability to import last year's data automatically into this year's preparation.
* The ability to E-file your taxes with the federal government which speeds up your refund, if you are getting one.
* The itemized deductions for gifts to charity is very helpful as we donate quite a bit every year and it makes it easier to compile a list, keep it for your records and come up with a reasonable value to claim on your taxes.
* I actually pre-calculate my next year's taxes and print out the forms to mail in quarterly payments for the next year's taxes to avoid a penalty.
* The ability to keep a PDF copy of your tax return forms for your records as well as print out the forms it you need them.
* I always save my tax computer files and I buy the disk version of TurboTax in case I have to reinstall the software and make an update or file an amended tax return later on.

The nice thing is that you can update the program and make sure that you have all of the latest updates to the tax laws and forms.  Having TurboTax walks me through the forms and helps me fill them out faster and easier than reading all of those tax pages written for lawyers.

I just use the combined federal and state version of TurboTax and file electronically.  This version includes the ability to file up to 5 Federal tax reports electronically. You can download the state version of TurboTax for one state for free.  If you want to file your state return electronically then you have to pay for the privilege.  I like the fact that I can quickly do my state taxes after finishing the federal forms.  I also always estimate my next year's taxes and print out the prepayment forms that I customize to fit what additional income I am expecting.

These are just a few of the main features that I like with TurboTax and I recommend the software to you as an easy tool to use. I do wait to find a good price on it as the price keeps going up and up every year.",A solid and reliable tax software program that I have used for many years!,1385424000,127,

I was on hold for sixty minutes with TurboTax while I was searching its site for questions and found a bunch of other users with the same problem.  While you can check your filing status by bringing up TurboTax and selecting check status, and can change the birth date and then refile, it is a problem that users should be aware of since it is a simple matter to check the birth dates, or any other data that has been imported from last year.  I was just so used to not encountering any issues that I failed to even look at the data.  Just passing this issue along....

I've used TurboTax for years without issue.  I tried Tax Cut (I think it was called that) many years ago and quickly returned to TurboTax.

I started not to get TurboTax this year, based on all those negative reviews, but thanks to 'gut instinct', all is good.

Oh, for the Software itself, yeah the Important part of the review, I really can't say much ... I hate math and I hate doing taxes.  That's why I choose TurboTax ... They do it all for me :)  Even though our taxes are really pretty simple/straightforward, all I have to do is fill in the blanks.

Zero problem importing my past year return, which is a huge time saver.

This review is for TuboTax 2013 Deluxe for Federal Returns. Fortunately I live in Texas and there is no state income tax so I don't have to worry about the state portion.

TurboTax has had its share of issues but I came back to it because it does seem to be the best there is, but I'm knocking off a star because of the history of issues I've had with the program in previous years (like it not calculating tax correctly until I deleted some assets and then re-entered them). However, I was a little shocked to read that it requires 515MB of HD space PLUS up to 1.5GB more if Microsoft .NET 4 if not installed (Mac is only 360MB). Wow! That could be over 2GB of HD to do taxes. How inefficient we have become, bat at least HD space is cheap nowadays.

The system requirements specifically mention Windows XP, Vista, and Windows 7/8 but not Windows 8.1. When I installed it on my Windows 8.1 64-bit machine, installation (mid Jan 2014) seemed to go well without any problems. When it checked for updates, it found 4 updates and they all seemed to install properly... so no major install issues for me (unlike a few years ago).

NOTE: Deluxe will do a Schedule C just fine, but it may not provide as much help as the Home & Business version. If you have been doing taxes yourself for awhile then you might not need to pay the extra money for the additional help.

I will update this review as I continue to use the product.

Pros:
* Price includes federal E-File
* Overall, probably the best tax program there is
* Does not say it works on Windows XP 64-bit (but does with 32-bit XP with SP 3+) (anyone even use XP 64-bit anyway?)
* Works on 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Vista and Windows 7/8/8.1
* Deluxe version can do a Schedule C for the self-employed - but it doesn't provide as much guidance as the Home & Business edition
* Claims that your return will be accurate, guaranteed* (with some fine print)

Cons:
* Not perfect (but how can US taxes ever be perfect)?
* Have encountered bugs in previous years that caused me to have to delete and re-enter assets
* Might take over 2GB of HD space on Windows according to the system requirements
* I'm not happy with the reports I've read indicating saying that Intuit lobbies Congress to keep taxes overly complicated, presumably so they can make more money from sales of their tax software.

WARNING ABOUT THE ONLINE VERSION (DOES NOT APPLY TO DESKTOP VERSION):

* Intuit has removed the ability to do Schedule D and E in TurboTax Online Deluxe (you need Premier)
* Intuit has removed the ability to do Schedule C and F in TurboTax Online Deluxe (you need Home & Business)","Most likely the best there is, but not perfect",1390176000,13,

If asked to identify those chores that personal computing and online services have helped take the pain out of, I wouldn't hesitate to place income tax preparation at the top of the list. Before software, tax time was a three-day long parade of headache-inducing calculations, trips to the library for the correct forms, and the pain of the calculations from worksheets and schedules. While my tax situation has been relatively stable from year to year, TurboTax has compressed three days of extended misery over the correctness of my math to a much shorter period of compressed misery over the extent of my tax burden and interpreting IRS instructions. Intuit had a rough period in the early 2000s with both privacy and functionality in TurboTax (and a STINGY approach to how many users could prepare taxes from a single copy). Those days are happily in the past

This version allows you to prepare and E-File up to five federal returns. Installation was issue free and took less than 10 minutes in a Windows 7 machine (64-bit, Intel i7-3770 CPU @ 3.4 GHZ and 16 GB RAM). Updates since installation have also been painless. Because I had return data from last year's edition on my computer already, our personal data was already filled in, and the program smartly queried about the same sources of income and interest and deductions/credits as last year.

With all of my tax documents at hand, and a moderately complex 1040 filing scenario, I was finished in less than an hour. Other than the fundamental pain that comes with tax time: what's not to like about that?","After all these years, still taming the lions of tax time...",1389830400,5,

If you filed last year with TurboTax 2012, yes, it is basically the exact same program. But the behind-the-scenes stuff gets updated with new forms and tax laws, etc. I'm sure all of that costs plenty to keep up with, justifying having to re-buy what seems like the same program every year. Though it does beg the question, could we maybe just buy a single TurboTax and pay each year just for the updates and to e-file, instead of re-buying nearly identical software, and a new box and disc and updated marketing, etc. But I digress.

I file Married Filing Jointly and have a pretty simple tax situation (wife and I each have one job, no kids, standard deduction). And for this purpose it was EXTREMELY easy and simple to file. I've used TurboTax since 2011, and I really like how it imports the previous year and unless anything major has changed, you basically just swap some numbers around and you are DONE! I probably spent less than 10 minutes importing my 2012 return and updating it for 2013. Since I've used TurboTax for the last 3 years, it also shows you a tax history with your history of income and taxes. It's kind of fun to see a trendline over the years, especially if it is (hopefully) in the upward direction.

What I also like, is switching back and forth between the ""hold my hand' version of the software and the raw tax forms. Some of the questions and situations TurboTax asks me about, I am curious what actual tax basis there is to the question. So after I fill it out, I switch to the forms and see exactly which fields on which forms are being populated based on my answers. It can help you understand tax filing much better to actually look at all the forms being submitted rather than relying solely on the user-friendly walkthrough version. But if that stuff doesn't interest you, it seems accurate and reliable enough to not really need to fret too much over it either.

Make sure you look at the difference between the TurboTax versions (Basic, Deluxe, Premier, Home & Business) so you don't leave tax deductions/credits on the table. Deluxe was what I needed, but depending on your situation it may benefit you to pay a little extra for the pricier ones. Or, if you have a pretty simple tax situation and could file a 1040EZ, maybe the cheapest basic one is all you need!

If you are new to TurboTax and will not have anything to import from last year, it takes a little longer, but it is still pretty quick to enter everything in. I could maybe do mine from scratch in 20 minutes. Granted, many people have all kinds of deductions and credits or self-employment details (or if you bought/sold real estate or stocks etc.) that could drastically lengthen the time it takes to go through the process. But all I know, is for me personally, this product is simple, thorough, and exactly what I needed. I fully intend to purchase TurboTax again next tax year.

FYI: The IRS will not process returns in 2014 for tax year 2013 until after January 31st, so don't feel too rushed to buy this and file immediately, as you will still need to wait until *at least* February for any possible refund.","If you have used TurboTax before, you know what to expect",1388966400,,

Thankfully you can usually pick it up at a discounted price ($50 -vs- $60) at Amazon earlier than from other sellers (Intuit is usually the LAST one to offer a price-break),  I have only bought TTax on CD over the years (not digital download) so that I have the disc just in case I might need to re-install at some future (like IF the TaxMan were to come a'knockin', God forbid).  Point being I can't comment on the Download approach.
My only gripe with Intuit (not this package, per se) is the $40 gouge price for an additional State.  At thathigh price, it's got to be a super-high margin item for Intuit's bottom line.
