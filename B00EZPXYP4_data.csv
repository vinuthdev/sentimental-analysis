5.0,False,"11 4, 2013",A3CG93783LP0FO,B00EZPXYP4,{'Platform:': ' PC Disc'},Yarii (cat mom),"I've used Norton 360 since 2009, except for a 6 month time period about a year ago when I tried Avast-Free which left me with 2 Trojan files that Norton 360 picked up on the minute I re-installed it. Since this is a 3 PC copy, I also installed it on my old desktop PC I use for work projects, and on my netbook. This runs unobtrusively in the background, even when doing a short scan, and doesn't slow any of my PC's down.

Here is what I have mine installed on:

Home Desktop PC: Windows 8.1, 3.4 Ghz Processor, 4 GB memory, Chrome browser
Home Netbook: Windows 7 Starter, 1.66 Ghz Processor, 2 GB memory, Mozilla Firefox browser, latest version
Old Desktop PC: Windows XP Professional, 2.4 Ghz Processor, with only 512K memory

I also think it's smarter to purchase the CD in lieu of downloading from Amazon. I like to have a physical copy in my hand in lieu of a download. Similarly, buy the CD instead of updating direct from Norton's web site. It's always more expensive from Symantec's site than buying a new installation CD here.",As great as always,1383523200,36,

Here is what I like about this product :

- easy to install and very user friendly to use
- provides robust protection against on-line threats and viruses

4.0,False,"11 3, 2013",AMUP8DYE7EAN2,B00EZPXYP4,{'Platform:': ' PC Disc'},mateo52,"Because, while I'm not about to go looking under the hood and I can't see where the mechanics published any new exciting information about modifications to the engine, all I see are some rather inconsequential cosmetic changes to the user interface like the banner on the home screen now appearing as white rather than black ,Insight being relegated to a sub-menu,a link to download a power eraser tool if all else fails and  something about a cloud there's no way I'll ever use. So, if you were satisfied with the performance of the 2013 version of this security suite, nothing about this version should cause any concern (...well, other than installing it which we'll get to in a moment). If the interest is a first time install or a revisit to the Norton family, I am going to reiterate much of last year's review, because for the typical home user, I still believe this security alternative is among the most comprehensive and easiest to use packages presently available whether the need is for one PC or multiples.

However, as far as installation is concerned, there is unquestionably room for improvement. With the de-emphasis of internal optical drives, many software developers are moving toward downloadable products. Norton 360 still has a physical CD available but the recommended option is download from the Norton site, so naturally my choice is to install from the CD which is supposed to upgrade the existing version...yeah, right or more accurately.. yeah, but not without encumbrances like a conflict between two versions that is not resolvable without a hard restart. My suggestion would be to delete the old version and do a fresh install if the decision is to go with CD install. It might mean loss of histories, existing network mapping and resetting preferences but it might also be less of a headache than trying to transfer them via the supposed upgrade capability. From my second PC, I did go the online route and it worked without incident.

That said, and feeding into my unabashedly admitted laziness, the following is an excerpt from last year's review, and as I am a fan of the 360 product, probably a preview of my review of next year's version:

Norton 360 is a comprehensive security suite with an array of processes and tasks consolidated in a single application. The complement of features can be found in the manufacturer's description above. Each of the features could be addressed through other resources and admittedly, a few of them might well be more effectively administered by standalone apps, but for the user who wants to set it and forget it, this product is among the top choices.

For less knowledgeable users, who may desire to find out more about security protocols and firewall settings, there are support functions here that can assist and increase awareness of threats they may not have even known they could monitor, of particular interest if surfing curiosity takes the user to a wide range of unknown sites.  I know with dynamic IP assignment, 360 is a fast and convenient way to identify physical addresses for all of the devices I have on my network with logging on the router.  Backup to external drives or online to the Norton storage site is also supported. In fact, the only difference between the standard and Premium additions of this suite is the amount of basic online storage available, with the standard addition providing 2GB and the Premium 25GB. Users, however, with multi-device platforms including Macs and mobile devices would be better served by purchasing the Multi-device version of this software.

I am rather obsessive about running registry cleanup and 360 offers another utility to supplement the shareware app I use most regularly. I do so because I do think any one product successfully identifies all files that could be cleaned. Similarly, Startup manager is another utility that can be assessed elsewhere but is another convenience found in this product and scanning performance can be improved by adjustments available with Norton Insight.","Um, Whatever I said last year.",1383436800,6,

She has worked with computers for decades and proudly holds the title of Family Geek to this day. She gifted me with my first license for Norton 360 about 2008 and I have resubscribed ever since.

The most important stuff that Norton 360 does is rarely noticeable. Every once in awhile, while surfing, I will get a heads up about a website known for malicious activity or told that a file I tried to download is corrupt. N360 runs regular scans to check for viruses and infections or to let me know when it is time to take some additional action to tune up for performance. My favorite and most used feature is the Identity Safe, which does exactly what Norton says: ""remembers, secures, and automatically enters your usernames and passwords for you, so they can't be lost or stolen.""

One trick that I learned (that at least one other person here has shared) is do not set up your account to automatically renew. I have a Google alert set up to let me know when Amazon and other retailers have it on sale. I have easily saved as much as 75% compared to what Norton would have charged me to auto-renew. You can even buy a couple at a time because the key codes stack.

Symantec Systems bought PC tools and then took them off of the market forcing me to change the antivirus software on 6 computers in the family.  Folks with a long memory will remember that this is not the first time that Symantec has done this with good products.  360 is an older attempt at an antivirus, system tune-up, back-up software and I don't think it does anything well.

I don't like the fact that these programs literally take over the entire Windows operating system and funnel EVERYTHING YOU DO thru the Norton servers for inspection. I also don't like the fact that putting this heavy weight software on a Windows computer can, and does, slow the machine down dramatically. Hence, I limit myself to using on Norton Antivirus, which I really do like.

My goodness... I just set up a new Dell computer for a friend (who is somewhat computer challenged), and he insisted on Norton 360. I installed Norton 360 on his new Dell, after deleting the default antivirus software Dell puts on their computers. And I was a little surprised at the efficiency of Norton 360. I didn't seem to be the big elephant in the room. It was much quieter, less annoying and ate fewer system resources.

I suppose this is an improvement that deserves praise. BUT I still don't like giving up complete control of my Windows operating system to Norton 360. I'm sorry, I just don't.","Funny thing about 360, I've changed my mind",1389052800,,
4.0,False,"12 19, 2013",A2U6GHU2EMC5M5,B00EZPXYP4,{'Platform:': ' PC Disc'},Rawim,"I remember back in the day.  Norton was really the only game in town when it came to anti-virus protection.  Then came along McAfee and we had some competition.  Now there are a multitude of options out there and I have had some experience with just about all of themand to be honest I still think Norton is the best.

Reasons for that: I feel Norton still spends the most resources on updating and fighting new threats compared to others.  I have interacted with them before on a particular virus problem and they were very good and very professional.  And I believe they take very seriously all the threats that are out in the world.

360 is Nortons kind of all in one product, meaning it focuses on everything from viruses in downloads, scams in email, outside intrusions into your personal network.  The software really does try to offer a 360 degree protection for your machine.

This is a one user, three license product, meaning it is intended for one person to use on perhaps three different machines.  You basically sign up for your Norton account and you can now download the software on to three separate machines.  One desktop, two laptops; or two desktops and one laptop, you get the picture.  You can move the licenses if you need to but it is a bit of a hassle.  As uninstalling Norton is never easy.

The two biggest negative things I have to say about Norton is that, one, it is a resource hog.  You really need a somewhat up to date computer.  Anything too old or two slow and this software can cause things to come to a crawl on your computer.  You won't have any viruses, but your computer will run pretty darn slow.

The other thing I don't like is the control scheme, Norton can be really easy to use, if you let Norton do what it wants, but if you are a power user, and you like to change a lot of settings and really control what Norton does and when it does it, it is harder rather than easy.  I wish Norton would have two different interfaces.  One for regular users, and perhaps one for power users that allows easy changing or settings.

Other than those two issues I still like the product and will continue to use it.  If you have a question about the product, feel free to leave a comment below and I will try to answer it.","Not Perfect, But Still The Best",1387411200,,

My prior Norton 360 license was about to expire when I was offered the 2014 version, which I did not hesitate to order. The first difference I noted is that, contrary to prior installs, this time I had to uninstall the old license to be able to install the new one (rather than simply updating the required files), the whole uninstall/install process took less than ten minutes.

Another thing I noticed was different is that the security ID application is not installed as a part of the whole application, a link will take you to the Norton website where you can download and install. This is one of the features I use the most so for a moment there I was worried I would have to purchase separately.

My experience with Norton 360 has always been great and this time it was not different, so far, there are no performance issues in my laptop that could be associated to the antivirus running in the background (which does happen with McAfee) and the interface is really easy to use and get used to if you are a new user.

I have yet to decide whether or not to install in my iPhone, this is of course an upgrade, as the prior version was compatible with Android only.

1 user that includes 3 licenses is pretty neat for the protection you get; as a part of the package you are also offered backup storage for up to 2GB, this may not be too much but I am certain it will be useful to more than one person. In days in which external drives are the norm, 2GB may not seem as much, but if used to backup essential data that you may need if on the run, well, it may be worth it.

My external drives I only use at home and at the office so it is great to have the protection on to ensure any potential threats are identified. The thing I use the most is the online protection, in the past, Norton 360 has helped me avoid malicious attacks and potential unsafe websites, also the functionality to save all your passwords under a single Norton account is amazing.

This is the third of four programs (each offering something more) offered by Norton to protect computers. There is Norton Antivirus, Norton Internet Security, Norton 360 and Norton 360 Multi-Deivice.  Norton 360 Multi-Device allows you to add protection to smart phones and tablets as well as computers. Norton also has a line of mobile and tablet security.

Once you purchase this you get a one year subscription. After the year is up you can either buy another year of service from Norton or buy the product from a third party like Amazon. In my case I was given the opportunity to review this for free through the Vine program so jumped at the chance to do so.

One of the nice features with Norton is that once installed it will always update to the latest version of the software you purchased. As a result of this there is no pressure to try the new and improved version because you are getting the newest version of the software you purchased.

When you press the Norton icon you get a screen that has security, identity, backup and tuneup options.  Each option gives you a number of choices such as when to run scans or updates or how to manage identity protection. It is easy to use and ideal for people who are not computer experts.

Norton Safe Search will also appear when I search the Internet.  There is a search box and if you go through it Norton will let you know if a site is safe or not.

One of the things I like about Norton is there is 24 hour live free technical support available for issues with installation or product use in general. I had an issue this year that may have been virus related and I called technical support. The agent addressed my concern and thankfully it was not a virus issue.

Over the past year I have had a couple of warnings that a virus had been blocked.  I have yet to have a virus problem in the years I have been using Norton products.

When you buy a Norton product you get 365 days of updates to keep your computer protected from the latest spyware and virus threats.  I had four months of my subscription left and a Norton agent was able to add that to the year that came with this product.

When I first started using Norton many years ago I would use additional programs for added protection against spyware. I just use Norton now. I am confident that it will protect my computer from virus or spyware issues. Additionally when scans are running I can still work on my computer without everything slowing down.

Review-wise, I think Norton 360 is a great product and works well for me. The only issue I have with it is the stupid cloud based  (these days) password ""vault"". I preferred the older, local  password manager, which on one of my PC's, is the way I still have it set up. I made the mistake of logging onto Symantec one day with my user ID and password, and it kind of ""Grabbed"" my password manager and made it the cloud based vault thing, which sounded OK, but when I logged into it with my Laptop, which had fewer log-ins and passwords, it for some crazy reason synched the cloud data FROM my laptop. When I used my desktop next time, the Cloud password data got synched TO my desktop and I lost 3/4 of my log ins and passwords. Fortunately, I back up my passwords to a local hardrive file with a built in, but awkward to find utility in Norton to import or export, and I was able to get it all back.

This product comes boxed, with an instruction card (with product code) and CD. I installed on 3 PCs, 2 of them Windows Vista, and one PC a Windows 7 platform. It installed smoothly in all caes.

It also installed the latest Norton toolbar, including Vault which can be helpful as a way of bringing up password-protected sites, and this latest Norton imported my passwords intact (including the password to open Vault). These days, when you need different (and un-memorizable) passwords for every site, this function is more important than ever. This latest version of Vault is more user-friendly and intuitive.

You can load from the CD or online from Norton. One oddity if you download online: in Windows it doesnt automatically load to the usual Download file, at least not in Vista. I had to specify a folder. Ive loaded from the CD and it seemed easier, at least in Vista.

Some features I haven't seen before:
1. Option to install from the furnished CD or to go to Norton online and enter the product code. If the latter, be advised it takes some time to download even with DSL. Once I had done so, it finished and installed with no problem and no apparent need for updates that day. It helps if you already have a Norton account but you can set one up.
2. The CD can serve as a recovery disk. You will need to set your computer to boot from disc, before the need arises.
3. After installation, Norton online support came up with this: I want to download my Norton product on my device. Protecting your devices and managing your Norton product is as easy as adding a new device in the Norton Management portal. Follow these instructions to install or reinstall ...

Since I used this product for three PCs on a home LAN, this was not essential but it was an interesting option, but seems more useful if you have other types of devices.

I have never had a problem in all those years.  The 360 takes Norton Antivirus to a new level and is excellent.  This is easy to install.
The one complaint that I have had in the past is the extra files it downloads for extra subscription services but it seems they have either stopped this practice or they don't pop up like they used to. So this is just a minor warning but I think they have fixed it.
You can load this to three different devices for the same price.",The 2014 version of a great product.,1384819200,,

Me, I love Norton, and Norton 360 is no exception. I've been using Norton products for a long time and even tried other similar products in the past, but always have found my way back to Norton products. In the past, Norton seemed to slow down my computer, which is why I tried other programs that were similar. The newer Norton programs don't do that. I have an older laptop running windows 7 and Norton does not slow my computing speed down at all. I love all the protection the 360 provides. Norton has caught and stopped more than one attack on my computer and has also caught viruses that I'm not sure other programs would have stopped. Love that I can buy it once and put it on 3 different computers, but be aware that the 1 year count down for the product starts with the 1st computer you install it on.",Norton 360 is great protection,1384473600,,

Not in awhile have I had issues with Norton bogging my system down. Runs silently and efficiently on the sidelines protecting your pc. Seems to do the job has stopped a few intrusions but never had anything major enter to really test. The 3 licenses is a good bonus for people who have multiple systems.

I've pretty much worked with computers all my life - and, since day one, I have always wanted things to be easy.  I always reasoned that silicon chips have a really lousy union and they should do all the grunt work not me.

Well, Norton's 360 product just about fits the bill.  I get to protect 3 computers on one subscription (are you hearing this Microsoft?).  Installation is pretty easy and the program pretty much runs itself and updates itself automatically.  I really don't know everything the product does (OK I'm a computer expert but that doesn't mean I want to know everything about every product - I want things to be easy) but it covers the essential like virus protection and performance checking pretty thoroughly.

It does have a function that will back up your system to their (I guess) cloud but it costs money - I prefer to spend less than $100 and get several years worth of backup for all my computers by buying an external/removable disk drive with 1 or 2 or 3 terabytes (that's an ocean of backup space) for all of my computers.",Getting this is a no-brainer,1383782400,8,
2.0,False,"11 7, 2013",A3H7ADUP07D93H,B00EZPXYP4,{'Platform:': ' PC Disc'},J. Fuchs,"I switched to Norton after a decade + with Trend Micro, and I'm not really happy with the switch.

It is, of course, difficult to tell how well any security program is working without intentionally visiting infected sites, which I'm not about to do.  So I'm operating on the assumption that Norton is detecting viruses and spyware as well as Trend, though I have no way of being sure.

My problem with Norton is that it makes everything else run very slowly.  Outlook, in particular, takes forever to open and programs frequently hang.  I have an older PC desktop running Windows 7, but it handles most software without noticeable delay -- or at least, it used to.

Norton also lets a surprising number of pop-ups get through, which Trend never did.  I never realized how many of these Trend actually caught, until it was gone.

All in all, unless someone running tests on Norton verifies that it does a much better job than other programs at catching the nasties, I can't recommend it.","Extremely slow, and not very good with pop-ups",1383782400,,

This particular product gives you 3 licenses, which you know you're eventually going to want another license if you buy computers often, so I definitely recommend going ahead and getting the 3 pack like this.  Norton has prevented several viruses from infecting my computer.  When I've tried competitors they've let things through.  I also love the Norton 360 for the password management system, which keeps track of all your passwords even across computers.  It really is a game-changing product.

There is a peace of mind factor that a professional version gives you, and for the less than tech savvy it's a bit more idiot proof than a bare bones free ware.  I have no problem with free ware, as my computing needs are pretty simple, but a pro version is very nice and this is pretty cheap for the year long comfort of install it and then pretty much forget about it security.  I got this current product via the Vine, but I have bought the professional 360 Norton for the two years running previously when it has been on sale.  I have multiple computers so the 3 license is handy and I do tend to use all three.  For the most part Norton is comfortable and user friendly especially if you aren't overly expert with using software.",Easy Security,1383782400,,
